    <p>The theory of automata is a branch of communication that explores how machines work, providing a foundation to design feedback loops and decision&#8211;making scenarios.

    <p>Intelligent systems interpret interactions through modelling and then respond accordingly. This model of decision pathways that I designed is an example of providing feedback of a student model based on an expert model. The pathways comprise dialogues represented with letters and possible decisions represented with numbers.
      <br><br>Decisions aligned to an expert model are coded as positive while other decisions are coded as negative. Feedback is targetted on positive and negative outcomes. The system is deterministic with finite memory. Feedback is adjusted depending on accumulative outcomes through decision sequencing, for example 1→ 5→ 9. Critical thinking skills are mapped to the decisions and, consequently, the feedback.

   <br><br>
   The definition of computational thinking varies.
   <br><br>My proposal is to consider computational thinking as human&#8211;computer interaction connected to the theory of automata whereby humans input and computers output to create artifacts. A model is a type of artifact within data literacy.

  <p>Inferential reasoning comprises exploratory analysis of data to draw conclusions (Guadalupe & Gómez&#8211;Blancarte, 2019). Computational thinking within data literacy is math reasoning, including informal inferential, combined with critical thinking plus the power of computers (Leard & Lamoureux, 2020). We can use computers to do work more efficiently for us (Berikan & Özdemir, 2019), like compute thousands of lines of data.
  <br><br>
  Under that definition of computational thinking, we can apply computational thinking strategies. Strategies used while interacting with a computer comprise complex combinations of tactics purposefully selected for task attainment (Leard & Hadwin, 2001). The foundational process is decomposing to look for patterns. We can design and translate algorithms into code to look for patterns. With the output of these algorithms, we can infer through abstractions (Berikan & Özdemir, 2019).
  <br><br>
  Abstractions can be in the form of computational models (Gadanidis, 2020): data visualizations and data analyses. Computational models are created within the data science analysis process and are evidence of math reasoning and critical thinking within that process.
