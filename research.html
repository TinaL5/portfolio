   The definition of computational thinking vary.
   <br><br>My proposal is to consider computational thinking as human-computer interaction connected to the theory of automata whereby humans input and computers output to create artifacts. A model is a type of artifact within data science.

  <p>Inferential reasoning comprises exploratory analysis of data to draw conclusions (Guadalupe & Gómez-Blancarte, 2019). Computational thinking within data science can combine math reasoning, including informal inferential, with critical thinking plus the power of computers (Leard & Lamoureux, 2020). We can use computers to do work more efficiently for us (Berikan & Özdemir, 2019), like compute thousands of lines of data.
  <br><br>
  Under that definition of computational thinking, we can apply computational thinking strategies. Strategies used while interacting with a computer comprise complex combinations of tactics purposefully selected for task attainment (Leard & Hadwin, 2001). A foundational process of computational thinking is decomposing to look for patterns. We can design and translate algorithms into code to look for patterns. With the output of these algorithms, we can infer through abstractions (Berikan & Özdemir, 2019).
  <br><br>
  Abstractions can be in the form of computational models (Gadanidis, 2020): data visualizations and data analyses. Computational models are created within the data science analysis process and are evidence of math reasoning and critical thinking within that process.
