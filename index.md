Data-informed decisions in athletics are becoming increasingly popular, and technology is providing the opportunity to make sports analytics more approachable. Analyzing data on team performance can provide insight into game play while making data literacy meaningful. We situate computational thinking within data literacy, talk about possibilities for data collection, and explore data analysis with Python in Jupyter notebooks. Connections to math, physical education, and team sports for grades 7 to 12 will be highlighted in the context of data science.

Variations of this online workshop were presented at...
- Southern Alberta Teachers' Convention 2021
- Central Alberta Teachers’ Convention Association 2021
- British Columbia Blended Digital Ed Conference 2020
- Mathematics Council Alberta Teachers’ Association 2020
